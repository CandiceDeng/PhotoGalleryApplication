# Photo Gallery Application

## About

This application allows users to register in and get access to the photo gallery, as well as to grayscale and filter images by its dimension (width to be more specific). It can be visited through <strong>"http://8992fadc.ngrok.io/register"</strong> directly without the need of installing any package. <br/>

```

2. After entering all required information to the "Create Account" form, the user will be directed to the gallery page.

### Image Manipulation
1. Clicking the "GrayScale" button would change all current listed images into grayscale, while clicking the same button when it shows "Colorful" would turn images to their original status.

2. By moving the double-sided slider users could filter all images according to their dimension, only images with the right width would show on the page.
